# Zigzag Traverse

## Description
Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in zigzag order.

Zigzag order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.
  
## Sample Input
```
array = [
  [1,  3,  4, 10],
  [2,  5,  9, 11],
  [6,  8, 12, 15],
  [7, 13, 14, 16],
]
```

## Sample Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```
