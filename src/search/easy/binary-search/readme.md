# Binary Search

## Description
Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise `-1`.

## Sample Input
```
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
target = 33
```

## Sample Output
```
3
```
