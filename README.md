# Description

This repository is meant to be a comprehensive reference guide for problems and topics to prepare for a Software Engineering job interview.

- Coding interview problems were taken from varios free online resources. While I don't own the problem statement, I coded the proposed solutions. There's no copy-pasting, but it is worth noting that sometimes I had to look for optimizations online. 
- Currently my main language with over 10 years of professional experience is C#, but I'm starting to solve some of them in Go that exhibits astounding performance.
- The code / functions implemented obviously compile, but you need to write a 'Main()' with tests in the right input format if you want to see them in action. I'll improve this in the future.
- Slowly adding quick reference summary on some key data structures and algorithms.
- Planning on adding systems design questions too.
