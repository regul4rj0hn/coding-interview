# Sum All Node Depths

## Description
The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of all of its subtrees' nodes' depths.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.

## Sample Input
```
tree =    1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \   /   \
   4     5 6     7
 /   \
8     9
```

## Sample Output
```
26
// The sum of the root tree's node depths is 16.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 2's node depths is 6.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 3's node depths is 2.
// The sum of the tree rooted at 4's node depths is 2.
// Summing all of these sums yields 26.
