# Max subset sum of not-adjacent elements

## Description
Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the maximum sum that can be calculated with non-adjacent elements in the array. I.e. elements in the array used to calculate the maximum sum cannot be next to each other in the array.

If the input array is empty, the function should return `0`.

## Sample Input
```
array = [75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]
```

## Sample Output
```
330
// 75 + 120 + 135
```
