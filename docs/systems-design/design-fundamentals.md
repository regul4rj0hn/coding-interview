# Design Fundamentals

## Intro
The coding interview serves primarily as an assessment of one's problem-solving ability. The difficulty in the vast majority of the problems lies in coming up with an optimal solution, so while you *are* required to implement your solution in a programming language, it could very well be represented with a pseudo-algorithm. This means that we don't really require any prior knowledge on how computer systems operate to pass coding interviews. 

The systems design interview on the other hand, is a test of the engineering knowledge usually hidden behind of an open-ended design question. Answering this type of questions will require solid system design fundamentals knowledge. Bear in mind that, as long as you are using the concepts correctly, answers cannot be objectively correct or incorrect, whereas on the coding interview a solution implementation either correct or incorrect - it builds and passes the tests or it doesn't. It's going to be on you to justify your proposed solution accordingly, explain the reason why the system components/design that you've chosen would work or not, and defend or adapt your position to follow-up questions the interviewer might have.

## Categories
Building scalable, production-ready applications can be both art and science. Science, in that it requires knowledge of many topics in computer engineering. Art, in that it demands an eye for making smart choices and piecing together the right technologies. 

The required areas of knowledge are naturally intertwined but they could be divided in four broad categories, that kind of overlap or build on top of each other.

### Foundational Systems Design Knowledge
Network Protocols, Client-Server model, Peer-to-peer communication, Storage, etc.

### System Characteristics
High Availability, Latency, Throughput, Redundancy, Consistency, Security, etc.

### System Components
Load-Balancers, Proxies, Firewalls, Caches, Rate Limitting, Leader Election, etc.

### Products & Services
Kafka, Nginx, Redis, AWS S3, GCS, etc.
