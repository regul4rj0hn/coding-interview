# Calendar Matching

## Description
Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. You have access to your calendar and your co-worker's calendar of `[startTime, endTime]`), as well as both of your daily bounds (i.e., the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings every day, in the form of `[earliestTime, latestTime]`).

Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your co-worker's calendar, your co-worker's daily bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, and that returns a list of all the time blocks (in the form of `[startTime, endTime]`) during which you could schedule the meeting, ordered from earliest time block to latest.

Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For example: `8:30`, `9:01`, and `23:56`.

Also note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in ascending order, as you would expect them to appear in a calendar application.

## Sample Input
```
calendar1 = [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]
dailyBounds1 = ['9:00', '20:00']
calendar2 = [['10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30', '15:00'], ['16:00', '17:00']]
dailyBounds2 = ['10:00', '18:30']
meetingDuration = 30
```

## Sample Output
```
[['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]
```
