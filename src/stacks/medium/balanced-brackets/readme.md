# Balanced Brackets

## Description
Write a function that takes in a string made up of brackets (`(`, `[`, `{`, `)`, `]`, and`}`) and other optional characters. The function should return a boolean representing whether the string is balanced with regards to brackets.

A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a certain type as it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched. Note that an opening bracket can't match a corresponding closing bracket that comes before it, and similarly, a closing bracket can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Also, brackets can't overlap each other as in `[(])`.

## Sample Input
```
string = "([])(){}(())()()"
```

## Sample Output
```
true // it's balanced
```
