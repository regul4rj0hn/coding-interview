# Number of Binary Tree Topologies

## Description
Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be created with exactly n nodes.

A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only two Binary Tree topologies when `n` is equal to `2`: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node.

Note that when `n` is equal to `0`, there's one topology that can be created: the `None` / `null` node.

## Sample Input
```
n = 3
```

## Sample Output
```
5
