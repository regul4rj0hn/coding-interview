# Line Through Points

## Description
You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a function that returns the maximum number of points that a single line (or potentially multiple lines) on the graph passes through.

The input array will contain points represented by an array of two integers `[x, y]`. The input array will never contain duplicate points and will always contain at least one point.

## Sample Input
```
points = [
  [1, 1],
  [2, 2],
  [3, 3],
  [0, 4],
  [-2, 6],
  [4, 0],
  [2, 1],
]
```

## Sample Output
```
4
// A line passes through points: [-2, -6], [0, 4], [2, 2], [4, 0].
```
