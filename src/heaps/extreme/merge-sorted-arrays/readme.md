# Merge Sorted Arrays

## Description
Write a function that takes in a non-empty list of non-empty sorted arrays of integers and returns a merged list of all of those arrays.

The integers in the merged list should be in sorted order.

## Sample Input
arrays = [
  [1, 5, 9, 21],
  [-1, 0],
  [-124, 81, 121],
  [3, 6, 12, 20, 150],
]

## Sample Output
[-124, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 20, 21, 81, 121, 150]
