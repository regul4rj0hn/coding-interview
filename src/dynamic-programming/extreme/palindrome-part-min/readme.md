# Palindrome Partitioning Minimum Cuts

## Description
Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string such that each remaining substring is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward as backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.
  
## Sample Input
```
string = "noonabbad"
```

## Sample Output
```
2
// two cuts delimitted by |: noon | abba | d
```
