# Minimum Heap Construction

## Description
Implement a `MinHeap` class that supports:
  - Building a Min Heap from an input array of integers.
  - Inserting integers in the heap.
  - Removing the heap's minimum / root value.
  - Peeking at the heap's minimum / root value.
  - Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when inserting and removing values.

Note that the heap should be represented in the form of an array.

If you're unfamiliar with Min Heaps, check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_%28data_structure%29) out.

## Sample Usage
```
array = [48, 12, 24, 7, 8, -5, 24, 391, 24, 56, 2, 6, 8, 41]

// All operations below are performed sequentially.
MinHeap(array): - // instantiate a MinHeap (calls the buildHeap method and populates the heap)
buildHeap(array): - [-5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 24, 391, 24, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41]
insert(76): - [-5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 24, 391, 24, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41, 76]
peek(): -5
remove(): -5 [2, 7, 6, 24, 8, 8, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41]
peek(): 2
remove(): 2 [6, 7, 8, 24, 8, 24, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 41, 48]
peek(): 6
insert(87): - [6, 7, 8, 24, 8, 24, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 41, 48, 87]
