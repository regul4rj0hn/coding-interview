# Palindrome Check

## Description
Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.


## Sample Input
```
string = "abcdcba"
```

## Sample Output
```
true // it's written the same forward and backward
```
