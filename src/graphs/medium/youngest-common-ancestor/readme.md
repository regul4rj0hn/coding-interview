# Youngest Common Ancestor

## Description
You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an `AncestralTree` class that have an `ancestor` property pointing to their youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in an ancestral tree (i.e., the only instance that has no ancestor--its `ancestor` property points to `None` / `null`), and the other two inputs are descendants in the ancestral tree.

Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendants.

Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor. So in the simple ancestral tree below, the youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.

```
// The youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.
  A
 /
B
```


## Sample Input
```
// The nodes are from the ancestral tree below.
topAncestor = node A
descendantOne = node E
descendantTwo = node I
          A
       /     \
      B       C
    /   \   /   \
   D     E F     G
 /   \
H     I
```


## Sample Output
```
node B
```
