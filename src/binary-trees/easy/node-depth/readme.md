# Node Depths

## Description

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None` / `null`.

## Sample Input
```
tree =    1
       /     \
      2       3
    /   \   /   \
   4     5 6     7
 /   \
8     9
```

## Sample Output
```
16
// The depth of the node with value 1 is 0.
// The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 3 is 1.
// The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 5 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 6 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 7 is 2.
// The depth of the node with value 8 is 3.
// The depth of the node with value 9 is 3.
// The sum of all dephts yields 16
